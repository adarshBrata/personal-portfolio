# React Best Practices for 2024

React continues to evolve, and with it, the best practices for building robust applications. Here are some key practices I've learned through my experience.

## 1. Use Functional Components with Hooks

Functional components with hooks are now the standard way to write React components. They're more concise and easier to test.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(userId).then(setUser);
  }, [userId]);
  
  return user ? <div>{user.name}</div> : <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

## 2. Proper State Management

Choose the right state management solution for your needs:
- **useState** for local component state
- **useContext** for sharing state across components
- **Redux Toolkit** for complex global state

## 3. Performance Optimization

- Use `React.memo` for expensive components
- Implement `useMemo` and `useCallback` judiciously
- Code splitting with `React.lazy`

## Conclusion

Following these practices will help you build more maintainable and performant React applications.
